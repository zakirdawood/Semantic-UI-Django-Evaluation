# Semantic-UI-Django-Evaluation
A website created to familiarize with the frameworks Semantic UI and Django. This website served as a submission to the final term project for CPS530. It uses Semantic UI to help create a simple yet elegant design. Django is used to send emails through our host email on our site. The website was hosted on Heroku.
