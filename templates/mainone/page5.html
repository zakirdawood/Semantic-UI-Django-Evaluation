    <h1 class="ui center aligned header" id="creator-title" style="color: cyan;">Did They Perform to Your Expectations?</h1><br>
    <p class="ui centered aligned paragraph" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; color: #EEEDF0;">Semantic UI performed a lot better than we expected. It made designing our website so much easier and our CSS files were minimal. Semantic UI's
        responsive design proved to be quite good despite the criticism. Overall however, we would like a few more design features with Semantic UI. Django performed up to our Expectations, 
        allowing us to create the back-end part of our website with ease. Django's email functionalities proved to be something quite useful for our website.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h1 class="ui center aligned header" id="creator-title" style="color: cyan;">Was it Easy to Install?</h1><br>
    <p class="ui centered aligned paragraph" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; color: #EEEDF0;">Semantic UI proved to be very simple to install as we only needed to add links to the head
        of our HTML files for the features we used. Django was a little more complicated but it did not provide us with any issues during installation.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h1 class="ui center aligned header" id="creator-title" style="color: cyan;">Was it easy to create the page(s) with it?</h1><br>
    <p class="ui centered aligned paragraph" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; color: #EEEDF0;">Semantic UI was very easy to create pages with. We utilized it for every page on this
        website for a consistent design. Django also proved to be quite easy to create pages with, especially with the features we used.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h1 class="ui center aligned header" id="creator-title" style="color: cyan;">Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP?</h1><br>
    <p class="ui centered aligned paragraph" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; color: #EEEDF0;">The learning curve for Semantic UI was not steep at all. It had an easy syntax set-up and
        documentation that was accessible and easy to read. Django proved to have a much steeper learning curve. We had a difficult time picking up the framework and were not able to get into its deep 
        features yet. That being said, we do look forward to learning more about the Django framework and how we could use it for more complex websites.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h1 class="ui center aligned header" id="creator-title" style="color: cyan;"> Would you have done things differently in retrospect? Did you regret your choice of frameworks?</h1><br>
    <p class="ui centered aligned paragraph" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; color: #EEEDF0;">While we do not regret our choice of frameworks, looking back, we may have done things
        differently if we knew about the steep learning curve of Django. We would have liked to experiment in a framework like Laravel that works in PHP as PHP is something we are much more familiar with. To do 
        things differently, we may have focused more of our attention on Django and compare its features to PHP to truly understand how to use the framework.
